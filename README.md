# AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tugberkugurlu/AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tugberkugurlu/AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB)

MongoDB data store adaptor for [ASP.NET Core Identity](https://github.com/aspnet/Identity), which allows you to build ASP.NET Core web applications, including membership, login, and user data. With this library, you can store your user's membership related data on MongoDB.

## Using the Library

[The library is available at NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB). You can start using the library by integrating it into your `project.json` file. This library supports [`netstandard1.6`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/library).

### Samples

You can find some samples under [./samples](./samples) folder and each of the sample contain a README file on its own with the instructions showing how to run them.

### Tests

In order to be able to run the tests, you need to have MongoDB up and running on `localhost:27017`. You can easily do this by running the below Docker command:

```bash
docker run --name some-mongo -d -p "27017:27017" mongo:3
```

After that, you can run the tests through your prefered test runner (e.g. JetBrains Rider test runner) or by invoking the `dotnet test` command under the test project directory.
